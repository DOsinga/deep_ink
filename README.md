Deep dreaming, but then restricted to just flipping pixels. It results in weird patterns that look like ink drawings if you squint a bit.

You need to download inception5h and unzip it in a subdirectory named inception5h before this will work. You can find that pretrained model at: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/assets/tensorflow_inception_graph.pb
